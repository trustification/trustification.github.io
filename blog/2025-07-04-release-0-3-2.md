Today we released Trustify `0.3.2`, exactly one year after [`0.1.0-alpha.10`](/blog/2024/07/04/release-0-1-0-alpha-10).
Read on to learn what's new and what happened in the last year.

## The past year

Time flies when you're having fun! It seems we've been so focused on development that we didn't pay much attention to the blog. During this time, we had the `0.2.z` release train, which served as the foundation for Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer 2.0. We also started working on the `0.3.z` stream, which brings us to today's release.

## New and noteworthy

Since we didn't cover any previous `0.3.z` releases, let's focus on the `0.3` series in general. Here's what's new:

* **Enhanced Analysis Endpoint** - Provides a fast way to search SBOMs and their relationships, even across multiple SBOMs
* **Quay Integration** - Added support for importing SBOMs from Quay instances
* **Improved Labels Experience** - Enhanced labeling functionality for better organization and filtering
* **UI Modernization** - Updated the user interface to PatternFly 6 for a more modern and consistent experience
* **OpenShift Data Foundation Compatibility** - Ensured full compatibility with OpenShift Data Foundation
* **License Reports** - New reporting capabilities for license information and compliance
* **Performance and Stability** - The usual bug fixes and performance improvements to keep everything running smoothly
